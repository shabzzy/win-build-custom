To bypass OEM activations:
==========================
 
Simply add this 'retail.txt' file to the "\Sources\$oem$\$$\Setup\scripts" folder of the ISO/USB where the oobe.cmd, OEM's.7z 
and decompile.exe files are located.

Do not place any key within this Retail.txt as it only used for a placeholder to tell the software that you wish to use a key later 
to activate your OS Edition.

Once this 'Retail.txt' file is detected the software will not use any SLP (vista/7/Servers) or MSDM (8.x/10) key found.  

You will then have to enter your key via PC Settings (8.x/10) or via the link in the 'Basic Information' screen where you can 
click the link to change the product key. 

More information can be found on the internet on how to do this for your Windows Version.

Remember, the key you enter must match the OS version in order to activate online once installation has completed.
